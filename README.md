    <h2 style=background-color:skyblue>About swacch Bharat</h2>
    <p>Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM), Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, or Clean India Mission is a country-wide campaign initiated by the Government of India in 2014 to eliminate open defecation and improve solid waste management. The program also aims to increase awareness of menstrual health management. [2] It is a restructured version of the Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan launched in 2009 that failed to achieve its intended targets.Initiated by the Government of India, the mission aimed to achieve an "open-defecation free" (ODF) India by 2 October 2019, the 150th anniversary of the birth of Mahatma Gandhi[6] through construction of toilets. An estimated 89.9 million toilets were built in the period.[7] The objectives of the first phase of the mission also included eradication of manual scavenging, generating awareness and bringing about a behavior change regarding sanitation practices, and augmentation of capacity at the local level.</p>

    <p>The second phase of the mission aims to sustain the open defecation free status and improve the management of solid and liquid waste, while also working to improve the lives of sanitation workers.[8] The mission is aimed at progressing towards target 6.2 of the Sustainable Development Goals Number 6 established by the United Nations in 2015. By achieving the lowest open defecation-free status in 2019, India achieved its Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6.2 health target in record time, eleven years ahead of the UN SDG target of 31 December 2030.

The campaign's official name is in Hindi. In English, it translates to "Clean India Mission". The campaign was officially launched on 2 October 2014 at Rajghat, New Delhi by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It is India's largest cleanliness drive to date with three million government employees and students from all parts of India participating in 4,043 cities, towns, and rural communities.</p>

  <p>Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is an ambitious project. When other countries are aiming at the Moon and Mars without improving the lives of the people, the Indian government has taken a people-first approach. Along with the Clean India campaign, it is also necessary to make our hearts cleaner. We must respect each other, we must respect women, and we must not attack each other in the name of religion or caste. Only after that, we can say – we are clean physically as well as spiritually. This mission is not about any political agenda, said PM Modi, but rather to awaken a spirit of patriotism among the people. Teamwork is vital, and people need to devote 100 hours a year to the mission since it can't be achieved by one person or by the government alone. Every Indian citizen is responsible for keeping India clean and green.As a result of the mission, death and lethal diseases rates in rural areas were reduced and households in rural areas received an annual benefit of Rs. 50,000. With an increase in employment opportunities, Clean India attracted many tourists from all over the world, thereby enhancing the nation's GDP and economy.

  <p> The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is the most significant cleanliness campaign by the Government of India. Shri Narendra Modi led a cleanliness pledge at India Gate, which about thirty lakh government employees across the country joined. He also flagged off a walkathon at Rajpath and surprised people by joining in not just for a token few steps, but marching with the participants for a long way.

While leading the mass movement for cleanliness, the Prime Minister exhorted people to fulfil Mahatma Gandhi’s dream of a clean and hygienic India. Shri Narendra Modi himself initiated the cleanliness drive at Mandir Marg Police Station. Picking up the broom to clean the dirt, making Swachh Bharat Abhiyan a mass movement across the nation, the Prime Minister said people should neither litter, nor let others litter. He gave the mantra of ‘Na gandagi karenge, Na karne denge.’ Shri Narendra Modi also invited nine people to join the cleanliness drive and requested each of them to draw nine more into the initiative.

By inviting people to participate in the drive, the Swachhta Abhiyan has turned into a National Movement. A sense of responsibility has been evoked among the people through the Clean India Movement. With citizens now becoming active participants in cleanliness activities across the nation, the dream of a ‘Clean India’ once seen by Mahatma Gandhi has begun to get a shape.

  <h2 style=background-color:pink>INTRODUCTION</h2></center>
  <p>Cleanliness is next to godliness – we all have read this quote. Our Bapu, Mahatma Gandhi, was particularly interested in banishing, along with the British, all the dirt and impurities that plagued our nation and its citizens. He had known since then that cleanliness leads to a healthy body and mind.Inspired by Bapu’s vision, on 2 October 2014, the Indian government, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, made it a mission to make India clean by 2019 by eradicating open defecation, improving solid waste management, and making the citizens aware of the importance of cleanliness. The name of this mission was Swachh Bharat Abhiyan or Clean India Movement.
    <h2 style=background-color:yellow>Objectives of the Swachh Bharat Mission</h2></center><img src="C:\swacch Bharat\swacch Bharat.jpeg" alt="swacch Bharat online image" width=750 height=350/></center>
     <p>A primary goal of the campaign is to eliminate the practice of open defecation and provide basic sanitation facilities by providing toilets, solid–liquid waste disposal systems, clean drinking water, etc. It aims to clean streets, roads, towns, and infrastructure in 4041 statutory towns and cities across the country. According to UNICEF, a single gram of faeces can host millions of viruses and parasites. These viruses and parasites are the reason that every year one lakh children die of diarrhoea.While making India open defecation-free by 2014 was the main aim of the mission, it also aimed at making people more aware of the problems created by solid and liquid wastes when garbage management is not done properly. The Swachh Bharat Mission aimed to make rivers, drainage system, buses, offices, and streets cleaner.It is also among the objectives of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan to make the citizens of the country aware of their utmost responsibility to maintain cleanliness and prevent filth from spreading around the country. 
  <h2 style=background-color:Orange>The Launch of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan</h2></center>
     <p>Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is not something that happened overnight. India is a big country and improving it requires meticulous planning. Before the Swachh Bharat Mission, the previous two cleanliness missions in India paved the path for the most successful cleanliness drive of 2014–2019. The campaign was conceived in a conference organised by UNICEF and the Indian Institute of Technology in March 2014. Later that year, on the birthday of the father of our nation, Mahatma Gandhi, the Swachh Bharat Mission was flagged off. It was a daunting project that required the construction of 90 million toilets across the country. The seriousness of the mission can be judged when we see that the government earmarked 1.96 crore rupees for the project.The Prime Minister also nominated nine public figures to spread the word, including Sachin Tendulkar, Priyanka Chopra, Salman Khan, Baba Ramdev, Shashi Tharoor, Kamal Hassan, Anil Ambani, Mridula Sinha, and the entire cast of the famous television series Taarak Mehta ka Ooltah Chashmah. Nine people had to be further nominated in order to form a chain system.
